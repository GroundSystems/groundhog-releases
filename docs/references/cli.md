## Name

`groundhog`: maintain a Groundhog append-only event log and its embedded analytical warehouse.

## Synopsis

```text
groundhog [--config <PATH>] <COMMAND>
groundhog --help
groundhog --version
```

Current commands:

```text
groundhog init [DIR] [--config <PATH>]
groundhog serve [--config <PATH>]
groundhog seal [--config <PATH>]
groundhog project [--config <PATH>]
groundhog rebuild [--config <PATH>]
groundhog verify [--chain] [--config <PATH>]
```

## Description

`groundhog` is the Groundhog binary containing a durable event log, a rebuildable DuckDB
warehouse, a Unix-socket HTTP service, and operator lifecycle commands. Connectors and applications use the
HTTP interface; operators use the CLI to initialize, serve, publish, maintain, and verify one
deployment.

One deployment is selected by `groundhog.toml`. Its log is the durable truth. The warehouse is
derived state that may lag the log and can be replaced by replaying it.

The current binary is local and owner-controlled. It enforces only security mode `open`.
Operations that would extend or attest history support integrity anchor `none`; they refuse a
stronger configured anchor requirement.

## Global options

### `--config <PATH>`

Selects the instance configuration. The default is `./groundhog.toml`.

The option is global and may appear before or after the subcommand. Every command except `init`
loads it. Relative paths inside the file resolve against the configuration file's directory.

`init` accepts the option because it is global, but ignores its value and writes
`<DIR>/groundhog.toml`.

### `-h`, `--help`

Print top-level or command-specific help and exit 0.

### `-V`, `--version`

Print the package version and exit 0. A release build may include a stamped source revision as
`<version>+<revision>`.

## Commands

| command | purpose |
|---|---|
| [`init [DIR]`](/commands#init) | Create or validate an immediately serveable deployment. |
| [`serve`](/commands#serve) | Run the ingest, replay, query, and catalog service. |
| [`seal`](/commands#seal) | Seal the append tail into immutable segments. |
| [`project`](/commands#project) | Publish a fresh warehouse generation. |
| [`rebuild`](/commands#rebuild) | Reconstruct the disposable warehouse from the log. |
| [`verify [--chain]`](/commands#verify) | Verify storage and optionally the integrity chain. |

The cohesive [commands reference](/commands) owns command behavior, concurrency, output,
exit status, and examples.

## Ownership and concurrency

| command | deployment access | may run while `serve` is active |
|---|---|---:|
| `init` | creates or validates owned paths | no |
| `serve` | log writer and public socket owner | it is the server |
| `seal` | log writer | no |
| `project` | coherent log reader; warehouse publisher | yes |
| `rebuild` | coherent log reader; warehouse publisher | yes |
| `verify` | coherent read-only log analysis | yes |

Only `serve` and `seal` mutate the log in the current CLI. They never bypass the one-writer rule.
`project` and `rebuild` coordinate with a separate warehouse-publication lock and publish complete
files atomically. A query already in progress remains pinned to its original generation.

## Standard streams

Human lifecycle output and diagnostics go to standard error. Its exact wording and line count are
not stable interfaces.

`init`, `serve`, `seal`, `project`, and `rebuild` have no machine-readable standard output.
`verify` writes exactly one JSON document to standard output on exit 0 or exit 3. Help and version
requests also use standard output.

Automation should use exit status, parse only documented standard-output documents, and treat
standard error as human context.

## Exit status

| code | class | meaning |
|---:|---|---|
| 0 | success | The command completed; every requested verification check passed. |
| 1 | operational | I/O, permission, engine, held-lock, batch-conflict, or corrupt-state open failure. |
| 2 | usage | Arguments or configuration are unusable; deployment work was not attempted. |
| 3 | verification | `verify` conclusively found a violation and emitted its JSON report. |
| 4 | refusal | The operation is deliberately unavailable for the security mode, anchor, capability, or compatible format. |

Configuration errors are usage failures because validation happens before deployment state is
opened. A malformed storage format found by `verify` is exit 3; a non-verification command that
cannot open corrupt state is operational exit 1. Exit 4 is for a structurally classifiable but
unsupported capability or compatibility state.

## Configuration

`groundhog.toml` controls the data directory, security mode, anchor requirement, Unix socket,
optional bearer token, query bounds, and replay bounds. Unknown keys are rejected.

See the [configuration reference](/references/configuration).

## Available HTTP surface

The current service exposes:

| route | function |
|---|---|
| `POST /v1/events` | Atomic idempotent JSON batch ingest. |
| `GET /v1/events` | Ordered replay from a coherent log snapshot. |
| `POST /v1/query` | Confined read-only SQL against one warehouse generation. |
| `GET /v1/catalog` | Published source/stream metadata and receipt. |

There are no current CLI wrappers for those client operations. See the
[HTTP API reference](/references/http-api).

## Unavailable names

The binary does not accept `import`, `query`, `catalog`, `erase-payload`, `export-key`, or
`verify --clean`. Passing one is a usage error. Unsupported commands are rejected rather than
partially performed.

## Examples

Initialize and serve a deployment:

```sh
groundhog init ./instance
groundhog serve --config ./instance/groundhog.toml
```

Publish a new warehouse generation while the service remains live:

```sh
groundhog project --config ./instance/groundhog.toml
```

Run deep verification:

```sh
groundhog verify --chain --config ./instance/groundhog.toml
```
